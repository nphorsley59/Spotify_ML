# Spotify Song Preference Project

### Project Overview

Using a decision tree classifier, I constructed a model that can predict Spotify user song preference to ~75% accuracy with a 'train' dataset of 2,000 songs. Please note, this project was completed with the guidance of a YouTube tutorial by Wes Doyle (link below).<br />
